Mars 19 2015 - v1.3

This release fixes several issues and adds geometric operators. It is also
possible now to format an sql script with one statement per line, which is
the reverse of the standard used.

	- Update Copyright year.
	- Add geometric operators. Thanks to Devin Ben-Hur for the report.
	- With one statement per line format, keep comment on separate line.
	  Thanks to Marco Schmidt for the patch.
	- Allow pgFormatter to format an sql script with one statement per
	  line (no line-break, no indent, no comments) when -s | --space is
	  set to 0. Thanks to Marco Schmidt for the patch.
	- Restrict regex matching in the ASCII range only with "use re /aa;".
	  Regex that has a look-ahead or look-behind AND uses the "i" modifier
	  need the "aa" modifiers too. This is for perl>=5.14. For perl<5.14
	  you will just have a warning about non existant re pragma. Thanks
	  to Kevin Brannen for the patch.
	- Fix bug where capitalize makes functions disappear. Thanks to Vincent
	  Picavet for the report.
	- Fix usage where obsolete -c option was still used.
	- Add new sample file.
	- Fix left joins that came out too far to the left and remove newline
	  after OUTER. Thanks to Kevin Brannen for the report.

	- Fix issue in formatting double quotes included into single quotes.
	  Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the report.
	- Fix issue with Perl 5.16 that do not allow "ss" inside look-behind
	  assertions. Thanks to Cedric for the report.

	  when major keywords were found. Thanks to Kevin Brannen for
	  the patch.
	- Add information in code comments about external files in
	  CGI mode.
	- Force the parser to not insert a new line after the SET
	  keyword when the query begin with it. This is to preserve the
	  single line with queries like SET client_encoding TO "utf8";
